# HW2-for-AI

## PART I:
### Implement the search algorithms
1. Depth first
2. Breadth first - Autri
3. A* algorithm - Zack

> Compare their performances from two points of view as follows:
> 
> (1) Correctness (5 points)
> The algorithm finds the path from a start city to the goal city (Bucharest), or returns empty if no path exists.
> 
> (2) Efficiency (5 points)
> Consider the number of cities visited before the path is found and the total cost, or the algorithm returns that there is no path (In this latter case, you may want to put a bound on the number of times a city is revisited

## PART II:
### The paths (that is, the list of cities) 
The paths generated by each algorithm from the following three cities
to Bucharest: Oradea, Timisoara, Neamt. For each path, list the path cost

## PART III & IV:
### Discussion of correctness & efficiency
