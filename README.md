# HW2-for-AI

## PART I:
### Implement the search algorithms
Compare their performances from two points of view as follows:
(1) Correctness (5 points)
The algorithm finds the path from a start city to the goal city (Bucharest), or returns empty if no
path exists.
(2) Efficiency (5 points)
Consider the number of cities visited before the path is found and the total cost, or the algorithm
returns that there is no path (In this latter case, you may want to put a bound on the number of
times a city is revisited

## PART II:
### The paths (that is, the list of cities) generated by each algorithm

## PART III & IV:
### Discussion of correctnes & efficiency

## PART I: Discussion comparing the four algorithms:
### Run the four algorithms on the same list and compare their performance
> "examples of runs, and the results obtained along with an analysis comparing the behavior of these algorithms (for example, number of pairwise element comparisons, or execution time)"
